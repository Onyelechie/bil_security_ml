## On-Device Intrusion Detection and False Alarm Filtering

This project is part of COMP 4560: Industrial Project (Winter 2026) in collaboration with BIL Security.

### Project Overview

Security monitoring systems often generate false alarms due to environmental factors such as weather, vegetation, or animals. This project develops an on-device alarm filtering solution that analyzes live camera feeds to detect meaningful intrusion events (presence of people or vehicles) while filtering out non-critical motion.

The system operates on constrained hardware (Windows PCs with i5/i7 processors and ~4GB RAM) and supports multiple simultaneous camera feeds accessed via RTSP.

### Objectives

- Investigate computer vision and AI techniques for on-device intrusion detection
- Filter false positives caused by weather, animals, or vegetation
- Support configurable sensitivity and monitoring zones
- Evaluate performance under hardware constraints

### Team Members

### Development Setup

### Configuration (.env)

Before running the server or migrations, copy the example environment file and update values for your environment:

```powershell
copy .env.example .env
# On Unix/macOS: cp .env.example .env
```

Important variables (see `.env.example`): `DATABASE_URL`, `HOST`, `PORT`, `DEBUG`, `CORS_ORIGINS` (comma-separated), `SECRET_KEY`.

Note: Edge agents SHOULD provide `edge_pc_id` when sending alerts. The server accepts
alerts that omit `edge_pc_id` for backward compatibility: when missing the server will
store a sentinel value `'unknown'` for provenance. If you prefer strict provenance,
use the `scripts/backfill_unknown_edge_pc.py` helper to map historical alerts and the
`remove_unknown_sentinel_20260223` migration to clean up the sentinel when safe.


### Database Migrations

This project uses Alembic for database schema migrations. If you change any models, you must generate and apply a migration:

1. **Generate migration script:**
  ```bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
  python -m alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Describe your change"
  ```
2. **Apply migration:**
  ```bash
  python -m alembic upgrade head
  ```

This ensures your database schema matches your models. See the `alembic/` folder for migration scripts.

CI note: The repository's CI workflow runs database migrations before running tests so
the test environment mirrors migration state used locally. Ensure migrations are
committed before opening a PR.

### Notes about databases and migrations

- SQLite is used as the default development database for convenience. It is NOT recommended for production deployments where durability, concurrency, and advanced SQL features are required. For production, prefer PostgreSQL or another production-grade RDBMS and set `DATABASE_URL` accordingly.
- The `detections` column uses SQLAlchemy's `JSON` type; behavior differs by database. On SQLite it will be stored as text — JSON operators are available on PostgreSQL but not on SQLite.
- If you are migrating an existing database into Alembic-managed migrations, follow these steps:
  1. **Backup your DB** (copy the SQLite file or take a dump for other DBs).
  2. If the existing schema already matches models and you don't need to run migrations, mark the DB as up-to-date with:
    ```bash
    python -m alembic stamp head
    ```
  3. If you need to apply new migrations, review autogenerated migration scripts carefully before applying, then:
    ```bash
    python -m alembic upgrade head
    ```

Security note

- The repository contains a development `SECRET_KEY` default. Do not run the server in production with the default key. The server will warn at startup if `DEBUG` is False and the `SECRET_KEY` is left as the default.

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

#### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Onyelechie/bil_security_ml.git
cd bil_security_ml

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix/Mac:
# source .venv/bin/activate
```
# Install dependencies
**Runtime (to run the system):**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Dev/Test (to run tests + lint/type checks):**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```


#### Running the Central Server (Area C)
```bash
# Set Python path for src/ layout
# On Windows PowerShell:
$env:PYTHONPATH = "$PWD\src"
# On Unix/Mac:
# export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src"

# Run the server
python -m uvicorn server.main:app --reload --port 8000
```



### Endpoint Purpose

- **Heartbeat** (`POST /api/heartbeat`): Used by edge PCs to report their own status and last-seen time to the server. This lets the server track which devices are online and their current state.
- **Healthcheck** (`GET /`): Used by anyone (user, monitoring system, load balancer) to check if the server itself is running and responsive. Returns a simple status message.

---

### API Documentation

When the server is running, interactive API documentation is available:

- **Swagger UI:** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- **ReDoc:** [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

These docs are auto-generated from the code and always up to date. You can try out endpoints, view request/response schemas, and see example payloads directly in your browser.

### API Endpoints

#### Heartbeat Endpoint

**POST /api/heartbeat**

Used by edge PCs to report their status. The server records the time it receives the heartbeat as `last_heartbeat` (using its own UTC clock, not the client timestamp).

**Request Body (HeartbeatIn):**
```json
{
  "edge_pc_id": "edge-001",
  "site_name": "Warehouse 1",
  "status": "online",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-17T12:34:56Z"
}
```

**Response (HeartbeatOut):**
```json
{
  "edge_pc_id": "edge-001",
  "site_name": "Warehouse 1",
  "status": "online",
  "last_heartbeat": "2026-02-17T12:34:56Z",
  "message": "Server received heartbeat"
}
```


**Model Conventions:**
- `In` models (e.g., `HeartbeatIn`) are for data sent from the client to the server (requests).
- `Out` models (e.g., `HeartbeatOut`) are for data sent from the server to the client (responses). The heartbeat response now includes a `message` field confirming receipt. The `last_heartbeat` field is always set by the server's current UTC time.

#### Alerts Endpoint
- **POST /api/alerts**: Ingests alerts from edge PCs (see code for schema).
- **GET /api/alerts**: Lists alerts (filtering to be implemented).

Note: `alerts.edge_pc_id` is now a required foreign key referencing `edge_pcs.edge_pc_id`.
When upgrading older databases, a migration will insert a sentinel `edge_pcs` row with `edge_pc_id='unknown'`
and backfill existing alerts to reference this sentinel. If you prefer strict provenance, ensure
edge agents include `EDGE_PC_ID` with alerts so the server can store the actual edge PC id.

Postgres UUID defaults:
- A follow-up, Postgres-only migration has been added to set a server-side UUID default for `alerts.id`.
  This migration is no-op for SQLite and will only execute when the Alembic connection dialect is
  PostgreSQL. If you rely on DB-level UUID defaults in production, ensure the target DB supports the
  `uuid-ossp` extension or adapt the migration to your environment.

Sentinel lifecycle recommendation:
- The `unknown` sentinel is intended as a compatibility measure during upgrade. After rolling out updated
  edge agents, consider running a cleanup/backfill job to assign correct `edge_pc_id` values where possible
  and to remove or reclassify sentinel-marked alerts for analytics purposes.

Backfill / cleanup helper
- A helper script `scripts/backfill_unknown_edge_pc.py` is included to help migrate
  `alerts` rows that were backfilled with `edge_pc_id='unknown'`.

Usage examples (from repo root):

```
# Dry run (report only)
python scripts/backfill_unknown_edge_pc.py --dry-run

# Apply mappings from CSV (columns: site_id,camera_id,edge_pc_id)
python scripts/backfill_unknown_edge_pc.py --mapping mappings.csv

# Assign a default edge PC for all unknown alerts
python scripts/backfill_unknown_edge_pc.py --assign-default edge-1234

# Remove sentinel if no alerts reference it
python scripts/backfill_unknown_edge_pc.py --cleanup-sentinel
```

The script connects using the repository's configured DB (via `src/server/db.py`).

### Security & Production Notes
- CORS is now restricted to `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:8000` for development. **Update this for production deployments!**
- No authentication is enabled by default. Add API keys or JWT for production deployments.
- Alert listing filters are marked as TODO and will be implemented in future updates.


## Edge Agent (Area B)

The edge agent is the on-site Windows service that will:
- listen for motion events over TCP
- pull frames via RTSP
- run detection/decision logic
- send alerts + heartbeats to the central server

### Running the Edge Agent (PR1 skeleton)

```bash
# Set Python path for src/ layout
# On Windows PowerShell:
$env:PYTHONPATH = "$PWD\src"
# On Unix/Mac:
# export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src"

python -m edge_agent.main --print-config
```

See `docs/area_b_edge_agent_context.md` for architecture + demo environment details.

### Edge Agent HTTP API (PR2)

The edge agent can optionally run a small HTTP API so office staff (or the central server later) can confirm the edge PC is alive.

#### Run the Edge HTTP API
```bash
# Set Python path for src/ layout
# On Windows PowerShell:
$env:PYTHONPATH = "$PWD\src"
# On Unix/Mac:
# export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src"

python -m edge_agent.main --http-serve
````

#### Endpoints

* **GET** `http://localhost:8128/health`
  Returns a simple “ok” response if the edge agent is running.
* **GET** `http://localhost:8128/heartbeat`
  Returns edge identity (`edge_pc_id`, `site_name`), a basic status snapshot, and uptime.

> Note: This is the Edge-side heartbeat (server/office → edge).
> The Central Server heartbeat endpoint is separate (`POST /api/heartbeat`, edge → server).


## Running Tests
```bash
# Set Python path for src/ layout
# On Windows PowerShell:
$env:PYTHONPATH = "$PWD\src"
# On Unix/Mac:
# export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src"

# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run only heartbeat tests
python -m pytest tests/server/test_heartbeat.py -v

# Run only edge API tests
python -m pytest tests/edge_agent/test_edge_api.py -v
```

### Technical Notes

- "Motion events" (from the problem statement) can be sent from our existing software via TCP.
- Ideally, supported security cameras should be compliant with ONVIF Profile S and T standards:
  - [ONVIF Profile S](https://www.onvif.org/profiles/profile-s/)
  - [ONVIF Profile T](https://www.onvif.org/profiles/profile-t/)
- These standards define connection protocols for streaming video, including RTSP.
- Any cameras used will always follow one of these two profiles.
