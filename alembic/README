## Alembic Migrations Directory

This folder contains database migration scripts managed by [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/).

### Purpose
Alembic is used to track and apply changes to the database schema over time. Each migration script in `versions/` represents a change (or set of changes) to the schema.

### Common Commands
- **Create a new migration:**
	```bash
	python -m alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<description>"
	```
- **Apply migrations:**
	```bash
	python -m alembic upgrade head
	```

### Notes
- Migration scripts are auto-generated but should be reviewed and edited for accuracy.
- See the project `README.md` for full setup and workflow details.
